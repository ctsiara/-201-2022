## Listings 6.22 & 6.23 of "Computational Problems for Physics (with guided solutions using Python)"

### Listing 6.22 (Tsiara_Listing22.py)
The program computes the Hamiltonian matrix of a system, as well as the eigenvalues and according eigenvectors/quantum states. Then it presents the Hamiltonian in the eigenvector basis.

### Listing 6.23 (Tsiara_Listing23.py)
The program computes the SU3 group of generators and combines them to create new operators that raise or lower the state of up, down and strange quarks.
